abstract = "The quest for efficient utilization of renewable energy and development of sustainable, green energy sources have gathered enormous interest among the researchers since last decade. Solar and fuel cells provide a key solution to conversion and storage of energy. In this review, we revisited the potential of porous Si (PSi) and Dye Sensitized Solar Cell (DSSC) for their unquestionable facile state-of-the-art fabrication techniques. Porosity is turned out to be a blessing in nanostructured Si solar cell as it can be used for anti-reflection coating to absorb more sunlight, trap the photons by improving internal reflection, and excellent reusable substrate to reduce the cost of wafer. On the other hand, fuel cell technology is dominant when efficient green energy is a priority. One of the major components of fuel cell is porous electrodes. Researchers emphasize more on developing porous electrodes in order to achieve higher efficiency at low temperature which leads to less greenhouse gas emission, durability, noise-free reliable source of power."
